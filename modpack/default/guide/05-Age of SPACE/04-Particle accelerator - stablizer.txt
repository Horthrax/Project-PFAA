§2§lParticle accelerator - stablizer

To make uum even cheaper, you will probably want to increase the size of your accelerator ring. The fail rate, shown in the GUI, increase significanty with the radius. When it reaches certain value, the machine might just can't reach 100% of completion.
To deal this problem, you will need to add some stablizers to your accelerator.

For this purpose, you will need 3 accelerator advanced tunnel, 1 accelerator coolant port and some accelerator advanced hull.

First, choose 3 block on your ring, it is recommended to build it on somewhere show on the picture below since it will save you some hull blocks.

Break them, and replace original tunnel block with advanced tunnel block.

Replace all hull block with the advanced ones.

Now you need add another layer of advanced hull block above or below the original hull block, yellow glass represents the place you need to add your new block. Don't forget the layer below.

When completed, it should look like something like this:

Replace one top hull block with a coolant port.You need to feed it with ic2 coolant.

Now, break and replace the core block, after checking the structure, you are ready to go.
Each stablizer uses 1mb of coolant each tick, which means 1200mb per minute. You will need a steady supply of boric acid to allow it to work efficiently. And it will consume coolant even sitting idle.

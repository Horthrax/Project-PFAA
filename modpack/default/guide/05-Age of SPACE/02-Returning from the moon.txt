Assuming that you have obtained enough titanium, certus quartz and all 4 press from AE2, it's time to reinforce the industry, mainly in energy production.

You can now build gas turbines from advanced generators mod, which burns all fuels with a much higher efficiency.

The syngas producer can create syngas from solid fuels, which can boost your hydrogen production and increase the general yield of oil/gas processing.

If you found a pitchblende ore cluster and want some IC2 fission power, make sure to use the fluid reactor. The simple one has a very low efficiency while the output of fluid reactor has been boosted. The AG heat exchanger can be used with the fluid reactor with a higher heat-to-energy ratio. Also it prevents your reactor from blowing up when the server lags.

AE can be started now, but note that the power usage has been increased 10 times, so you might want to limit it to item storge for the moment.

Having your power grid augmented, it's time for another challenge: UU matter production

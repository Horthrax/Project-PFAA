§2§lParticle accelerator - mecanisms

§3§lDrag force
After placing the core block, it will start to scan the block behind it and save the location of each connected tunnel block.
An average value of all core block positions will be calculated, giving the "center" of the accelerator. The average distance from each core block to the "center" is then calculated, giving the radius of the accelerator R. The standard deviation of this average distance is then calculated as S, which represents the "roundness" of the accelerator.
The "dragforce" d is calculated as:
§C§ld = S * 1000 / R / ( N ^ 2 ) + kDrag
With N the number of tunnel blocks, kDrag a constant defined in the config file.

TL;DR: make your accelerator round will reduce the drag, also does increasing it's radius

§3§lFail rate
The fail rate is defined by:
§C§lrf = R ^ 2 * kFail
With kFail a constant defined in the config. The bigger your ring, the easier it will fail.

The fail rate can be reduced by each cooling system:
§C§lrf' = rf * kStablizer - 0.01
With kStablizer a constant in the config

§3§lAcceleration rate calculation
The acceleration rate is calculated by:
§C§la = kOverall * (kAcceleration * sqrt(I) * (random() > rf ? 1 : 0 ) - d)
With kOverall and kAcceleration a config value, I the eu/t provided to the machine.
When a reaches 100, the progress will reset and 1mb of UUM will be generated.
There is a squart root on the current, which means the higher the current, the lower the efficiency. But if the current is too low, there efficiency will also decrease due to the presence of dragforce. This means, for each specific setup, there is an optimum current. You need to find it out by calculation or experiment.

§2§lAdvanced circuits

By the time you made some machines from advanced rocketry mod, it's time to start up the production of highly-pure silicon.
This is required to fabricate advanced circuits from Techreborn, also to increase productivity.
The process itself is rather complex:

1: extract silicon dioxide from quartz, clay or quartizite sand.
2: Reduct SiO2 to technical silicon inside a IHL fluidized bed reactor.
3: Make Silicon tetrachloride then trichlorosilane from technical silicon, or silicon carbide (more efficient to begin with).
4: Decompose trichlorosilane to obtain a high-purity silicon dust.
5: Smelt the dust in a techreborn blast furnace, then crystalize it to get monocrystalline silicon.
6: Cut it into wafers, it's now ready for circuits.

Afterwards, you can craft some advanced machine casing to upgrade your Techreborn blast furnace so it can smelt SiO2 directly into technical silicon, which will save a lot of raw material. Step 4 can also be done in an AR reactor, which is easier to deal with. You can also make some solar satellites afterwards for some renewable power.

One of the most important device in this age is the techreborn grinder, it can increase the yield of your ores and simplify your production chain, also some high-tier ores can only be processed in this machine.
